This repository is a sample project to build a system to record patient's medical history as well as overall medicine stocks for individual doctor's clinic. Decided to use laravel because most of the hosting will provide Laravel installation with a click. In the near future this might be able to be used by doctor's especially in Indonesia.

Any contributors are welcome to join and build this application. For a better medical system for young and good doctor's out there. Cheers!
